    """Generate a UUID from a Unix timestamp in milliseconds and random bits.

    UUIDv7 objects feature monotonicity within a millisecond.

    Vendored from https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121119 w/ minor changes:

    1. Added a `random` argument to allow for seeding.
    2. Return an integer instead of a UUID object because:
     a. We need an integer anyway and would have just converted the UUID object to an integer
        (thus it's actually faster to do it this way than it will be in CPython!).
     b. The UUID object checks the version and variant, which currently rejects v7 UUIDs.
