"""What an adapter can do with a published config, declared as data rather than inferred.

Two facts about an agent are known only to its adapter and are needed everywhere else: which sections
and settings it can actually apply, and how faithfully it can tell an explicit per-run setting from a
default. Today both are expressed as branches -- a `supported=` collection here, a README footnote
there -- and the Logfire editor infers the first by reading the variable's `example`, which cannot
tell "this adapter cannot apply `tool_definitions`" from "this agent has no tools".

`AgentSupport` is that knowledge as one value: built by the adapter, published with the baseline, and
read by the editor. It describes the **adapter**, and only the adapter. What a particular model does
with a setting the adapter forwarded is deliberately not here -- that goes out of date the week a
provider ships, it belongs to whatever curates model metadata, and every framework Agent Control
drives already has its own reasoning for settings a model will not take.
