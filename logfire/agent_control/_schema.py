"""The stored JSON schema for an `agent__<name>` variable, shared with the Logfire Agent Control UI.

The Logfire UI holds a copy of this in `app/project/managed-agents/agent-config.ts`, and whichever
side creates the variable first is the one whose schema is persisted. The schema is not cosmetic: the
Logfire backend validates every new version of the value against it, so anything this schema rejects
cannot be written at all.

It is maintained by hand rather than taken from `AgentConfig.model_json_schema()` because the two
artifacts answer different questions. Pydantic's output describes *this* release's model on *this*
Pydantic version -- `$defs`, `anyOf [T, null]` wrappers, `default: null`, and `title` noise -- while
the stored schema is a long-lived contract between a Logfire project and every SDK version that will
ever write to it, in any language.

That is also why it is permissive at every level: `AgentConfig` ignores extra keys precisely so a key
written by a newer UI does not fail validation and revert the whole config to code, and an
`additionalProperties: false` anywhere in the stored schema would defeat that by rejecting the key at
write time instead. For the same reason the fields whose accepted values grow over releases
(`thinking`) are typed rather than enumerated, and `settings` names the canonical keys for the
editor's benefit while leaving unnamed ones writable: a key a newer contract adds has to be storable
before every SDK reading the variable knows it, and `AgentConfigSettings` ignores -- and, under
`OnUnmatched`, reports -- the ones this release cannot apply.

The constraints it does keep are structural rather than versioned, and each one closes a hole a
permissive schema would otherwise leave open. Every `minLength: 1` says the same thing as
`NonEmptyStr`: `''` is a half-filled field, never a value, and `model: ''` in particular takes an
agent down with an unknown-model error on every request. `tool_definitions` items require a `name`
because an overlay that names no tool cannot be applied to anything, so accepting it would only let
the UI save a row that silently does nothing.

"""SHA-256 of the stored schema's canonical JSON, which every other copy of this contract pins.

The contract has at least three copies -- this package, the TypeScript package, and the Logfire UI's
`agent-config.ts` -- written independently against the same prose, and prose is exactly what lets
them drift: two copies once differed in a description and in whether `id` accepted `null`, a real
difference in what each side would let you save, settled by whichever one happened to create the
variable first. A digest cannot drift quietly, and there is no artifact the repositories share to
hold the schema once. The canonical form is the JSON with sorted keys and `(',', ':')` separators, so
every language computes the same digest over the same bytes.

When a test pinning this fails, decide which side is right *before* repinning, then change all of
them.
