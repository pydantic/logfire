"""What the contract's one dimensioned setting means, and how to convert it without surprises.

`timeout` is the only canonical setting carrying a unit, and it is the only one an adapter has to
convert before it can be used: `AbortSignal.timeout`, `httpx`, and most CLI flags want integer
milliseconds. Left to each adapter, that conversion has already drifted three ways -- one truncating,
one rounding, one passing a fraction of a millisecond straight into an API that throws on it -- so
the range and the rounding are defined here, once, and the cores share these vectors.

Not an opinion about sensible timeouts, but the smallest ceiling the targets share. Browsers, Node,

or fires immediately -- which is the failure mode a managed setting must never introduce, since it
turns "no real limit" into "cancel at once".

    budget, a `nan` that compares false against every deadline, an `inf` or an oversized value that

    `round(0.0025 * 1000)` is `2`, not `3`.)

    A *positive* budget never rounds down to `0`: anything under half a millisecond comes back as
    `1`. Zero milliseconds means "already expired" to a timer, so rounding a small positive budget
