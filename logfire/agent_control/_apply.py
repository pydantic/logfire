    say "every `search`" and "the CRM's `search`" at once and the specific entry wins where both

    availability is dynamic -- an agent can advertise different tools from one step to the next -- and
    a report from one listing is a report about that listing.

    A rename onto a name that is already taken is dropped while that override's other patches still
    apply, so every tool keeps a name the model can call. What counts as taken is `collision_scope`
    plus `reserved`, and renames resolve in input order, so the tool that was there first keeps the

    Two decisions about the config as a whole rather than about any one entry, which is why they are
    here rather than in one section's helper: a top-level key this release has no section for, and a
    section it does have and the adapter declared it cannot apply.

    The first is the other half of the openness that makes a future `mcp_servers` or `skills` section
    readable by an older SDK. Unknown keys are ignored on purpose -- refusing them would make the day
    a section is added the day every older SDK stops resolving -- but an ignored key that nobody
    hears about is how the first person to publish one gets a silently degraded agent.

    """The `settings` section as a patch to merge over the agent's own settings.

    Only explicitly set, non-`None` fields are emitted, and every key is already a canonical
    `AgentConfigSettings` name, so `settings` is the patch: merge it over the framework's settings,
    let a per-call setting outrank it, and leave every key it does not mention alone.
    [`merge_settings`][logfire.agent_control.merge_settings] is how to do that merge with the
    contract's precedence and a record of which layer won each key.

    Five kinds of published thing come back on `issues` rather than being silently dropped, all for
    the same reason -- someone published something and the agent did not apply it, which is a gap
    between what Logfire shows and what the agent does:

    - a key this version of the contract has no field for (`'unknown-setting'`), which a newer
      Logfire UI can write;
    - a key this adapter cannot lower into its framework (`'unsupported-setting'`), which it names
      through [`AgentSupport.settings`][logfire.agent_control.AgentSupport.settings]. Leaving
      `support` as `None` says the adapter applies all of them;
    - a `timeout` that is not a representable request budget (`'unrepresentable-timeout'`) --
      negative, not finite, or past
      [`MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`][logfire.agent_control.MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS]. Dropped rather than
      clamped, because clamping turns "no real limit" into a deadline nobody published, and rounding
      a negative one to `0` cancels the request before it is sent;
    - a top-level key this release has no section for (`'unknown-section'`);
    - a section this adapter declared it cannot apply (`'unsupported-section'`).

    The last two are about the whole config rather than about settings, and they are here because
    this is the helper every adapter can call with the whole config and its own support declaration,
    whatever hooks its framework gives it: an adapter that never calls
    `apply_instructions` would otherwise have nowhere to learn that an `instructions` section was
    published at an agent that cannot apply one.

    Args:
        config: The resolved managed config.
        support: What this adapter can apply; see
            [`AgentSupport`][logfire.agent_control.AgentSupport]. `None` says it can apply every
            section and every canonical setting, which is the right answer for an adapter that has
            not been taught to declare yet and the wrong one for any that has.

      publishing it as one describes the code as doing something it does not do, in the one artifact
      the Logfire editor presents as the truth about the code. A timeout outside the representable

    own objects rather than from JSON, so an `int` where the contract wants a `float` and a tuple of

    This is what an adapter publishes as the variable's `example`, and the Logfire editor renders it
    as the code baseline to diff managed values against. It uses the same fields as a published value
    to say *what exists* rather than *what to change*, which it can because an `example` is
    documentation: nothing ever resolves or applies it. The whole contract -- what a baseline is, and
    what each section of one owes the editor -- is in this package's README under "What a baseline
    is"; this is the part of it a framework-neutral function can enforce.

    Instructions are listed block by block, each with the `id` that addresses it and a `dynamic` flag,
    which is the whole reason the UI can offer an override at all: a joined prompt has no seams in it,
    so a baseline built from that could only be copied wholesale -- and since managed instructions
    *add*, that is how you get the agent's own text sent to the model twice with a frozen
    `Today is <date>` in the middle of it.

    A dynamic block contributes that it exists, not what it said once. Its text is one request's
    rendering, built from whatever that request carried -- a tenant name, a user id, a retrieved
    document -- and the baseline is published to a variable every project member can read. The seam is
    what the editor needs anyway: enough to show the block and that it is not theirs to change. A
    dynamic block with nothing to key it on is left out entirely, since an editor can neither show nor
    address it.

    Every top-level parameter of every tool is listed, carrying its `description` when the code has
    one and an empty entry when it does not. The empty entry is the point: an undocumented parameter
    is exactly the one somebody wants to describe from Logfire, and a baseline that listed only the
    documented ones would hide it from the editor until it had been documented in code first.
