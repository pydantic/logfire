        default_span_processor: A function to create the default span processor. Defaults to `BatchSpanProcessor` from the OpenTelemetry SDK. You can configure the export delay for
            [`BatchSpanProcessor`](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/trace.export.html#opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export.BatchSpanProcessor)
            by setting the `OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY_MILLIS` environment variable.
        metric_readers: Legacy argument, use `additional_metric_readers` instead.
        additional_metric_readers: Sequence of metric readers to be used in addition to the default reader
            which exports metrics to Logfire's API.
