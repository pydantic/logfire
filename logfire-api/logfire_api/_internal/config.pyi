    Args:
        local: If `True`, configures and returns a `Logfire` instance that is not the default global instance.
            Use this to create multiple separate configurations, e.g. to send to different projects.
        send_to_logfire: Whether to send logs to logfire.dev.

            Defaults to the `LOGFIRE_SEND_TO_LOGFIRE` environment variable if set, otherwise defaults to `True`.
            If `if-token-present` is provided, logs will only be sent if a token is present.

        token: The project token.

            Defaults to the `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` environment variable.

        service_name: Name of this service.

            Defaults to the `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.

        service_version: Version of this service.

            Defaults to the `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_VERSION` environment variable, or the current git commit hash if available.

        environment: The environment this service is running in, e.g. `'staging'` or `'prod'`. Sets the
            [`deployment.environment.name`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/deployment-environment/)
            resource attribute. Useful for filtering within projects in the Logfire UI.

            Defaults to the `LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.

        console: Whether to control terminal output. If `None` uses the `LOGFIRE_CONSOLE_*` environment variables,
            otherwise defaults to `ConsoleOption(colors='auto', indent_spans=True, include_timestamps=True, include_tags=True, verbose=False)`.
            If `False` disables console output. It can also be disabled by setting `LOGFIRE_CONSOLE` environment variable to `false`.

        config_dir: Directory that contains the `pyproject.toml` file for this project. If `None` uses the
            `LOGFIRE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable, otherwise defaults to the current working directory.

        data_dir: Directory to store credentials, and logs. If `None` uses the `LOGFIRE_CREDENTIALS_DIR` environment variable, otherwise defaults to `'.logfire'`.
        additional_span_processors: Span processors to use in addition to the default processor which exports spans to Logfire's API.
        metrics: Set to `False` to disable sending all metrics,
            or provide a `MetricsOptions` object to configure metrics, e.g. additional metric readers.
        scrubbing: Options for scrubbing sensitive data. Set to `False` to disable.
        inspect_arguments: Whether to enable
            [f-string magic](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/onboarding-checklist/add-manual-tracing/#f-strings).
            If `None` uses the `LOGFIRE_INSPECT_ARGUMENTS` environment variable.

            Defaults to `True` if and only if the Python version is at least 3.11.

        sampling: Sampling options. See the [sampling guide](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/advanced/sampling/).
        add_baggage_to_attributes: Set to `False` to prevent OpenTelemetry Baggage from being added to spans as attributes.
            See the [Baggage documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/advanced/baggage/) for more details.
        code_source: Settings for the source code of the project.
        distributed_tracing: By default, incoming trace context is extracted, but generates a warning.
            Set to `True` to disable the warning.
            Set to `False` to suppress extraction of incoming trace context.
            See [Unintentional Distributed Tracing](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/distributed-tracing/#unintentional-distributed-tracing)
            for more information.
            This setting always applies globally, and the last value set is used, including the default value.
        advanced: Advanced options primarily used for testing by Logfire developers.
