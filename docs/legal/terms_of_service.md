_Logfire Service_.

## 6. Orders, Fees, and Payment

### 6.1 Orders Generally

All Orders are subject to the terms of these _Logfire Terms_ and are not binding until accepted by
_PSI_. Orders created by Customer through _Logfire Cloud_ are deemed accepted when _PSI_ provides access to
the service environment selected by Customer. _PSI_ may place controls and restrict the Customer's Orders of
_Logfire Cloud_ at its sole discretion. All Orders are non-refundable except as expressly provided in these
_Logfire Terms_.

## 6.2 Fees and Payment

The Customer must pay _PSI_ all fees incurred for its usage of _Logfire Cloud_ and any
additional fees specified in Orders. Where _Logfire Cloud_ are offered on a free trial basis, payment will be
required after the free trial period ends. Unless agreed otherwise in a written Order between the Parties, Customer's
use of _Logfire Cloud_ is subject to the fee schedule specified by the Site. The fees will be calculated and billed
monthly in arrears. If you choose monthly billing by credit card, you authorize a recurring monthly charge to your
credit card based on our current fee schedule for _Logfire Cloud_ specified by the Site and any additional fees
specified in Orders, and you must pay us the applicable fees and charges using your credit card. If paid by credit card,
all amounts payable to _PSI_ under these _Logfire Terms_ are due and must be paid within one (1) day from the end of a
billing cycle by Customer. If we send a separate invoice for payment rather than use credit card processing, all amounts
payable to _PSI_ under these _Logfire Terms_ are due and must be paid within fourteen (14) days from the date of invoice
by Customer. All amounts paid are non-refundable.

### 6.3 Taxes

All rates and fees are set out without value added tax (VAT) or any other applicable sales tax, which may
be added to the fees of your monthly bill or invoice in accordance with the then-applicable tax laws and regulations,
and you must inform us of your correct location to assist with determining the appropriate tax. Customer is otherwise
responsible for and will pay all applicable customs, duties, sales, use, value added, withholding, or other taxes,
federal, state or otherwise, however designated, which are levied or imposed because of the transactions contemplated by
these _Logfire Terms_, excluding only taxes based on _PSI_'s net income. If Customer is compelled to make a deduction or
set-off for any such taxes, Customer must pay _PSI_ such additional amounts as necessary to ensure receipt by
_PSI_ of the full amount _PSI_ would have received but for the deduction.

### 6.4 Credit Card Processing

For Orders that require payment by credit card, _PSI_ uses a third-party credit card
processing service to process payments. Customer consents to the use of such service and to the transfer of Customer's
credit card details (including any personal data contained therein) to such third-party processors. Customer agrees to
be bound by any separate terms applicable to the processing service. Customer's credit card will be charged fees
automatically for Customer's use of _Logfire Cloud_ at the end of each billing cycle. Currently, this third-party
credit card processing service is [Stripe, Inc.](https://stripe.com); the Customer is familiar and agrees to be bound
by any third-party terms applicable to the Stripe service.

### 6.5 Late Payments

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by
law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.

### 6.6 Changes to Fee Schedules

We may change the fee schedule for a _Logfire Cloud_, including by increasing fees or
charges, by updating the Site. In the event that we change the fee schedule for _Logfire Cloud_, the fees payable by
you will increase or decrease in accordance with any such modification upon the date specified by the Site. You are
deemed to accept the new fee schedule, and be responsible for any fees incurred under the new fee schedule, by
continuing to use _Logfire Cloud_ after the specified date.

## 7. Suspension and Discontinuation of Service

### 7.1

_PSI_ may suspend _Logfire Cloud_ immediately for a reasonable period of time in order to perform
installation, change, or maintenance work to _Logfire Cloud_, including by itself or by the network or hosting

### 7.2

_PSI_ may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer's access to or use of _Logfire Cloud_, or may

_Logfire Cloud_ poses a risk to _Logfire Cloud_ or to other users of _Logfire Cloud_; (c) we change the way we
provide or discontinue any _Logfire Cloud_; (d) if law or administrative order requires us to do so; (e) if we become
aware of or reasonably suspect any activities of Customer or its Authorized Users that infringe on the policies set out

contrary to or for a purpose prohibited by these _Logfire Terms_, applicable laws, or administrative orders.

_PSI_ may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer's access to or use of _Logfire Cloud_ or Support
Services, or may suspend, limit, terminate, or delete the Content and any Customer data and services, including any
backups thereof, immediately if (a) if the Customer does not pay in full the fees due under these _Logfire Terms_ by their
due date; (b) _PSI_ has reasonable belief that the Customer will not pay in full the fees due under these Cloud
Terms by their due date; (c) the Customer does not have a valid payment method associated with its Account and is not
within the term of a free trial; or (d) the Customer is within the term of a free trial or otherwise has not accrued any
fees due under these _Logfire Terms_. This suspension or limited access may continue until the Customer has paid all fees in
full and/or has associated a valid payment method with its Account. _PSI_ may notify you with warnings before and
may notify you after it takes any such action.

### 7.4

_PSI_ may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer's access to or use of any Beta Offering, or may suspend,

### 7.5

The Customer understands that _Logfire Cloud_ are hosted by a third-party hosting provider used by _PSI_
to implement _Logfire Cloud_. Such hosting providers may discontinue or modify their hosting at any time. _PSI_
is not liable in any way for any discontinuation or modifications of such services provided by hosting providers or
other subcontractors.

### 7.6

If _PSI_ suspends, limits, or terminates the Customer's access to or use of any portion or all of the
_Logfire Service_, the Customer remains responsible for all fees incurred during the suspension and will not be entitled to any
credit or refund.

## 8. Processing Personal Data

### 8.1

The terms of the _PSI_ Data Processing Addendum (available [here](data_processing_addendum.md)) (the **"DPA"**)
are hereby incorporated by reference and will

process Customer Personal Data on your behalf in connection with _Logfire Cloud_ provided to you under these Cloud

Personal Data as described in the DPA, including our security measures in Annex 2 of our DPA Standard Contractual
Clauses.

and documentation; and any derivative works, changes, corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, modifications, or
improvements of any of the foregoing ("**Modifications**"), and including any Feedback (collectively, the "**_PSI_
Materials**"). Except for the express limited rights set forth under these _Logfire Terms_, no right, title, or interest in
any _PSI_ Materials is granted to Customer. Customer acknowledges that the licenses granted in these _Logfire Terms_ do
not include the right to prepare any Modifications of the _PSI_ Materials. _PSI_ reserves all rights not
expressly granted in these _Logfire Terms_. No rights are granted by implication.

### 9.2 Feedback

You are not obligated to provide us with any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or
other feedback about _Logfire Cloud_, _PSI_'s products and services, or otherwise ("**Feedback**"), but if you
do, _PSI_ may freely use, incorporate, and modify such Feedback into Logfire Software, products, and services
without any restriction or payment.

## 10. Confidentiality

### 10.1 Confidential Information

Each party shall retain in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed or made
available by the other party. For purposes of these _Logfire Terms_, "**Confidential Information**" means any technical or
business information disclosed by one party to the other party that: (a) if disclosed in writing, is marked
"confidential" or "proprietary" at the time of such disclosure; (b) if disclosed orally, is identified as "confidential"
or "proprietary" at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in writing sent by the disclosing party to the
receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (c) under the circumstances, a person exercising
reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary. Notwithstanding any failure to so
designate it, the _PSI_ Materials are _PSI_'s Confidential Information and Content is Customer's Confidential
Information.

### 10.2 Confidentiality Obligations

Each party shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the other party's
Confidential Information using at least a reasonable degree of care; (b) refrain from using the other party's
Confidential Information except for the purpose of performing its obligations under these _Logfire Terms_; and (c) not
disclose Confidential Information to any third party except to employees, subcontractors, and agent as is reasonably
required in connection with these _Logfire Terms_ and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as protective
as those set forth in this Section 10.

### 10.3 Confidentiality Limitations

The confidentiality obligations will not apply to any Confidential Information of
the other party which (a) is now or hereafter becomes generally known or available to the public, through no act or
omission on the part of the receiving party; (b) was known, without restriction as to use or disclosure, by the
receiving party prior to receiving such information from the disclosing party; (c) is rightfully acquired by the
receiving party from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who provides it without restriction as to use or
disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without access to any Confidential Information of

regulation or by order of a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, provided that the receiving party uses
reasonable efforts to give the disclosing party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable
the disclosing party to prevent or limit such disclosure ("**Permitted Disclosures**"). _PSI_ will have no
obligation under this Section 10 for any Content or other data that Customer transmits to _Logfire Cloud_ in breach of
Section 5 (Acceptable Use Policy).

### 10.4 Other Confidentiality Terms

Each party shall immediately notify the other party of any unauthorized disclosure
or use of any Confidential Information and assist the other party in remedying such unauthorized use or disclosure by
taking such steps as are reasonably requested by such other party. The provisions of this Section 10 shall supersede any
non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties (whether entered into before, on, or after the Effective Date) that
would purport to address the confidentiality and security of Content and such agreement shall have no further force or
effect with respect to Content.

### 10.5 Injunctive Relief

Any breach or threatened breach of this Section 10 may cause irreparable harm to the
disclosing party for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the disclosing party will be entitled to seek
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond, in addition to any other remedies
available at law.

### 10.6 Confidentiality Period

The rights and obligations related to the Confidential Information shall survive the
termination of these _Logfire Terms_ for a period of three (3) years from such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the receiving party's obligations with respect to Confidential Information will survive termination of this Agreement so
long as the disclosing party is entitled to claim trade secret protections in the Confidential Information.

## 11. Warranties and Disclaimers

_PSI_ does not make or give any representation or warranty or condition of any kind, whether such representation,
warranty, or condition be express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, with respect to the _logfire cloud_, _PSI_
software, support services, or any materials provided hereunder. _PSI_ specifically disclaims all other warranties,
express and implied, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability, title, quality,
non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose, and any representation, warranty, or condition from course of
dealing or usage of trade. The _logfire cloud_ are provided on an "as is" basis, and _PSI_ does not warrant that the
_logfire cloud_ or _PSI_ software will operate uninterrupted or error free, or that all errors will be corrected.

## 12. Indemnification

### 12.1 Customer Indemnification

Customer will defend _PSI_ and our Affiliates and licensors from and against any
third-party claim, demand, or lawsuit (collectively, "Claims") arising out of or relating to (a) your use of the
_Logfire Service_ (including any activities under your Account and use by your employees and personnel) in breach of Section 5
(Acceptable Use Policy); (b) any breach of these _Logfire Terms_ or violation of applicable laws, rules, or regulations by
you, including in connection with _Logfire Cloud_; or (c) any Content or the combination of any Content with other
applications, content, services, or processes, including any Claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of
Intellectual Property Rights or other third-party rights. Customer will pay any damages, costs, losses, and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and other costs of defense) incurred by _PSI_ in connection with any Claim,
including but not limited to amounts paid by _PSI_ to settle such Claim. If we or our affiliates are obligated to
respond to a third-party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process, you will also reimburse us for reasonable
legal fees, as well as our employees' and contractors' time and materials spent responding to the third-party subpoena
or other compulsory legal order or process at our then-current hourly rates.

### 12.2 _PSI_ Indemnification

_PSI_ will defend Customer from and against any Claim arising out of the alleged
infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights by (a) _PSI_'s observability technology used to deliver the
_Logfire Service_, and (b) any Logfire Software expressly licensed under an Order (together, the "**Logfire Technology**"),
and _PSI_ will pay such damages or costs as are finally awarded against Customer or agreed to in settlement
attributable to any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _PSI_ assumes no liability hereunder for any claim
of infringement to the extent based on: (a) Content; (b) use of software other than a current, unaltered release of the
Logfire Software, as provided by _PSI_ to Customer; (c) the combination, operation, or use of the _PSI_
Technology with equipment, devices, software, services, or data (including without limitation the Content) not supplied
by _PSI_, if a claim would not have occurred but for such combination, operation, or use; (d) any alteration or
modification of the Logfire Software or _Logfire Cloud_ by a party other than _PSI_; (e) open source software; or
(f) use of the Logfire Technology other than in accordance with the Documentation and these _Logfire Terms_. In addition
to _PSI_'s indemnity obligations, if the Logfire Technology becomes, or in _PSI_'s opinion is likely to
become, the subject of an infringement claim, _PSI_ may at its sole option and expense and as Customer's sole and
exclusive remedy, either: (a) procure for Customer the right to use the allegedly infringing element of the _PSI_
Technology, at no charge to Customer; (b) replace or modify, in whole or in part, the Logfire Technology to make it
non-infringing; or (c) terminate the applicable Order, and refund a pro rata portion of any fees pre-paid by Customer
for the terminated _Logfire Cloud_. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH _PSI_'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION AND CUSTOMER'S
SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

### 12.3 Indemnification Procedures

Each party will provide the other with prompt notice of any claim. The failure of a
party seeking indemnification (an "**Indemnitee**") to provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party (an
"**Indemnitor**") relieves the Indemnitor of its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee only to the extent
that the failure to provide notice materially harms the Indemnitor's ability to defend the claim. The Indemnitor will
have sole control of the defense (including selection of counsel) and settlement of the claim, provided any settlement
releases Indemnitee from all liability. The Indemnitee will provide the Indemnitor, at Indemnitor's expense, with all
assistance, information, and authority reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the claim. The Indemnitee
will preserve and will not waive legal, professional, or any other privilege attaching to any of the records, documents,
or other information in relation to such claim without prior notification of consent by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee
has the right to retain counsel, at the Indemnitee's expense, to participate in the defense or settlement of any claim.
The Indemnitor will not be liable for any settlement or compromise that an Indemnitee enters into without the
Indemnitor's prior written consent.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

### 13.1

_PSI_ and our affiliates and licensors will not be liable to customer for any indirect, incidental,

subscription period for the Order, Customer may terminate an Order or _Logfire Cloud_ at any time by following the

written notice of termination. Either party may terminate these _Logfire Terms_ or an Order upon written notice in the event
the other party materially breaches these _Logfire Terms_ and such breach is not cured within thirty days after written
notice of such breach. _PSI_ may also terminate these _Logfire Terms_ for convenience by providing you thirty days

suspends its business, or ceases to operate in the ordinary course; (b) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors
or similar disposition of its assets; (c) becomes subject to any bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, insolvency, or

Upon termination or expiration of these _Logfire Terms_, (a) all your rights and all our
obligations under these _Logfire Terms_ immediately terminate; and (b) you remain responsible for all fees and charges you

the terms of Section 6. Upon termination of these _Logfire Terms_ or expiration of an Order, Customer will immediately cease
use of _Logfire Cloud_ and Logfire Software, and if applicable, the Support Services. Customer is solely
responsible for exporting Content from _Logfire Cloud_ prior to expiration or termination of these _Logfire Terms_. We
have no obligation to continue to store your Content from a _Logfire Cloud_, including in data backups, after you have
terminated _Logfire Cloud_ or after termination of these _Logfire Terms_. Customer acknowledges that following termination
it will have no further access to any Content. Notwithstanding the above, upon termination or expiration of these Cloud
Terms, the provisions of Sections 9, 10 (for the duration set forth in Section 10.6), 11, 13, 14.3, 15, and 16 will
survive and continue in full force and effect.

United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these _Logfire Terms_.

that is export controlled at a level higher than EAR99 under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations or on any other
dual-use or munitions export control list. If _PSI_ determines that Customer has breached its obligations under this
section, becomes subject to sanctions or an export denial, uses a sanctioned bank for processing of payments under this
agreement, or there is a change in applicable sanctions or export control laws that make performance of these Cloud
Terms impermissible or practically infeasible, _PSI_ shall have the right to suspend or terminate the _Logfire Terms_
and _Logfire Cloud_, if continued performance could result in _PSI_ being in violation, or subject to negative
consequences, under the applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations.

maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the Parties and will be reformed to the extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable. Our failure to enforce any provision of these _Logfire Terms_ will not constitute a
present or future waiver of such provision nor limit our right to enforce such provision at a later time.

otherwise notifying you by email. Amended Terms of Service become effective upon posting on the Site or as stated in our
