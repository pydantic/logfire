  partners, or affiliates for the purposes outlined in this statement.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)

_PSI_ processes Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity as set out above in the section [Personal Data We Collect](#personal-data-we-collect). The
basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing
activities typically fall under these lawful bases:

- Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill our contractual duties to you, in accordance with the _PSI_
  Terms of Service.
- Legal Obligation: We process data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights,
  safety, and property of _PSI_, our affiliates, users, or third parties.
- Legitimate Interests: We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing our
  Services, communicating with you, and improving our Services. This is done only when these interests are not overridden
  by your data protection rights or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
- Consent: We process data when you have explicitly consented to such processing. When we rely on consent as the legal
  basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time. The procedures for withdrawal are
  detailed in this Statement and available on our website.

## Your Privacy Rights of EEA and UK based individuals

Depending on your residence location, you may have specific legal rights regarding your Personal Data:

- The right to access the data collected about you
- The right to request detailed information about the specific types of Personal Data we've collected over the past 12
  months, including data disclosed for business purposes
- The right to rectify or update inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data under certain circumstances
- The right to erase or limit the processing of your Personal Data under specific conditions
- The right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, as allowed by applicable law
- The right to withdraw consent, where processing is based on your consent
- The right to receive your collected Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format to
  facilitate its transfer to another company, where technically feasible

To exercise these rights, please [contact us](#contact) and follow the instructions provided. To
verify your identity for security, we might request extra information before addressing your data-related request. Please
[contact our Data Protection Officer](#contact) for any feedback or concerns. Depending on your region,
you have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority. European users can find authority contacts on
the European Data Protection Board website, and UK users on the Information Commissioner's Office website.

We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we might retain certain
Personal Data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

## International data transfers

_PSI_ stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States,
and other countries where _PSI_, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal
Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not
recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the
Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) published by the European Commission under
[Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj),
help protect your rights and enable these protections
to travel with your Personal Data. To learn more about the European Commission's decisions on the adequacy of the protection of
personal data in the countries where _PSI_ processes Personal Data, see this article on the
[European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

When transferring personal data outside the UK, we use the or the Addendum to the SCCs published by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (the “ICO").

We may use specific standard contractual terms approved for use in the UK published by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (the “ICO") which give the transferred personal data the same protection as it has in the UK, namely the International Data Transfer Agreement or use the ICO’s International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses.

To obtain a copy of these contractual safeguards, please [contact us](#contact).

## Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

## Security

_PSI_ uses administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate to protect your Personal Data.

## Information for Minors

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from
such individuals. If you become aware that a minor has provided us with Personal Data, please [contact us](#contact).

## Changes to Our Privacy Statement

_PSI_ might periodically revise this Privacy Statement. If there are material changes to the statement, we will provide
at least 30 days prior notice. We might add a notification on our website, insert a pop-up that the statement has been updated, or send an email to your primary email address associated with your _PSI_ account. We will also update the copy of this statement available on our website.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

_PSI_ uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our
Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device
for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical
reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of _PSI_.

Our emails to users might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have
opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and
to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session"
cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they
expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose
of the cookie collection and tool used. You might be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see
["What are your cookie choices and controls?"](#cookie-choices-controls).

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and
provide our Services.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser
connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers
and letters that might uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web
server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called "single-pixel" or "clear GIFs") that are contained within a website or
email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web
server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about
your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded
videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The _PSI_ Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences
and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services,
develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies might be
provided by third parties.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The points below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

##### Required Cookies

_PSI_ uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services.
For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience,
improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times,
improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.

##### Analytics

We might use third party services which use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better.
For example, cookies might be used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task.

#### What are your cookie choices and controls? {#cookie-choices-controls}

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

Any _PSI_ page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page's footer to cookie settings. You
can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

- If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, _PSI_ will not set
  non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
- Many browsers provide cookie controls which might limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the
  documentation for your browser to learn more.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as
  [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third
  parties might be disabled.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as
  [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent
  that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
- You might use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If _PSI_ detects the GPC
  signal from your device, _PSI_ will not share your data (we do not sell your data).
  To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
- Advertising controls. Our advertising partners might participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of
  ad targeting, which you can access at:
- United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
- Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
- Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers,
take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

#### Mandatory Disclosures

Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), we provide this California Consumer Privacy Act Notice (the “CCPA Notice”) to California residents (“consumer” or “you”). This CCPA Notice supplements the information provided in our Privacy Statement.

##### CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED AND DISCLOSED

Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household. “Personal Information” does not include publicly-available information, deidentified or aggregated information, or information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws. “Sensitive Personal Information” refers to information that reveals a consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; contents of mail, email, and text messages unless PSI is the intended recipient of the communication; genetic data; and biometric information.

Below, we identify (1) the categories of Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information (as listed in the CCPA) that we plan to collect and use, and have collected and used within the preceding 12 months; (2) the categories of recipients to which we have disclosed each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for our operational business purposes within the preceding 12 months; and (3) the criteria we use to determine the retention period for each category of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information.

We collected the following categories of personal information in the last 12 months: identifiers/contact information, country, and information about your job title and organization.

We disclosed no personal information in the last 12 months.

In addition, we may disclose Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information) to government authorities or other parties to enforce our rights and comply with our obligations under applicable law, legal process, or government regulation.

We did not “sell,” and have not “sold,” personal information in the preceding 12 months, within the meaning of “sale” under the CCPA.

The sources of personal information and sensitive personal information from whom we collected personal data are: directly from you as a survey respondent.

The business or commercial purposes of collecting personal information are as summarized above and in our Privacy Statement under Processing Purposes.

We may use Personal Information to generate deidentified data sets. To the extent we treat data as deidentified under the CCPA, we will maintain and use that data solely in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify that data with any individuals, other than to assess whether the deidentification process complies with applicable law or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

The business or commercial purpose of sharing personal information is to assist us with marketing, advertising, and audience measurement.

We do not "sell" or "share" the personal information of known minors under 18 years of age.
