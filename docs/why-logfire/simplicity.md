This might look similar to simple logging, but it's much more powerful â€” you get:

- **Structured data** from your logs
- **Nested logs &amp; traces** to contextualize what you're viewing
- **Custom-built platform** to view your data, with no configuration required
- **Pretty display** of Python objects
