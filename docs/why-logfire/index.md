# Introducing Pydantic Logfire

From the team behind Pydantic, **Logfire** is an observability platform built on the same belief as our open source library — that the most powerful tools can be easy to use.

## What sets Logfire apart

-   :rocket:{ .lg .middle } __Simplicity and Power__

    ---

    Logfire's dashboard is simple relative to the power it provides, ensuring your entire engineering team will actually use it. Time-to-first-log should be less than 5 minutes.

-   :snake:{ .lg .middle } __Python-centric Insights__

    ---

    From rich display of **Python objects**, to **event-loop telemetry**, to **profiling Python code &amp; database queries**, Logfire gives you unparalleled visibility into your Python application's behavior.

-   :simple-pydantic:{ .lg .middle } __Pydantic Integration__

    ---

    Understand the data flowing through your Pydantic models and get built-in analytics on validations.

    Pydantic Logfire helps you instrument your applications with less code, less time, and better understanding.

-   :telescope:{ .lg .middle } __OpenTelemetry__

    ---

    Logfire is an opinionated wrapper around OpenTelemetry, allowing you to leverage existing tooling, infrastructure, and instrumentation for many common Python packages, and enabling support for virtually any language.

-   :abacus:{ .lg .middle } __Structured Data and SQL__

    ---

    Query your data using standard SQL — all the control and (for many) nothing new to learn. Using SQL also means you can query your data with existing BI tools and database querying libraries.

## Find the needle in a _stacktrace_

We understand Python and its peculiarities. Pydantic Logfire was crafted by Python developers, for Python developers, addressing the unique challenges and opportunities of the Python environment. It's not just about having data; it's about having the *right* data, presented in ways that make sense for Python applications.
