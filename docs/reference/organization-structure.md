The following diagram shows the structure of an organization in **Logfire**:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  Organization <-- OrganizationMember
  User <-- OrganizationMember
  User <-- ProjectMember
  Organization <-- Project
  Project <-- ProjectMember

  class Organization {
    UUID id
    string name
  }

  class User {
    UUID id
    string name
  }

  class OrganizationMember {
    UUID user_id
    UUID organization_id
    string role ['admin', 'member', 'guest']
  }

  class Project {
    UUID id
    UUID organization_id
    string name
  }

  class ProjectMember {
    UUID user_id
    UUID project_id
    string role ['admin', 'member']
  }
```

As a **user**, you can be a member of multiple **organizations**. On each **organization**, you can either be:

- [X] An **admin**: who can manage the organization and its projects.
- [X] A **member**: who can only view the organization and the projects that are shared with them.
- [X] A **guest**: who can only view the projects that are shared with them.

An **admin** can invite other users to join the organization.
When a user accepts the invitation, they become a **member** of the organization.

Each **organization** can have multiple **projects**. On each **project**, you can either be:

- [X] An **admin**: who can manage the project.
- [X] A **member**: who can only view the project.

If a user is invited to join a project, they become a **member** of the project, but they are a **guest** in the organization.

## Organization Types

Logfire has a similar structure to Github in that you have a personal org, and then can create
and/or belong to many other normal (i.e. non-personal) orgs. Both org types are functionally the same and you
can invite others to join either type of org. The only difference is that you can't convert a normal
org to a personal org.


|                       | Personal org                      | Normal org |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---|
| Admins                | Unlimited                         | Unlimited |
| Members               | Unlimited                         | Unlimited |
| Rename / change slug  | ✅                                 | ✅ |
| Convert to normal org | ✅ (one-way)                       | — |

### Which Org Type Should You Use?
While you *can* use your personal org for production use-cases (e.g. if you
are working alone or in a small team), you may wish to switch your personal org to a normal org if you are working
at a larger company and want to create a more "official" Logfire org for that company. This also means you don't have
to share your personal org's projects (which you may wish to keep private) with any colleagues.

### How Do I Switch from Personal to Normal Org?
In the personal org settings, you will find a section called "Convert to org", which will take you through a brief series of
steps where you will:

- Define your new (normal) organization's name and slug
- Edit the name of your personal org if you wish

After you do this, all projects, members, alerts, dashboards and settings will be migrated to the new org. You will
be the owner of the new org.
