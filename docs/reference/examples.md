## Python

### Flask and SQLAlchemy Example

This example demonstrates a simple Python financial calculator application built
with Flask and SQLAlchemy. It's instrumented using the appropriate integrations
and [auto-tracing](../guides/onboarding-checklist/add-auto-tracing.md). When you
run the server locally and interact with the calculator, you'll see traces being
automatically generated:

## JavaScript/TypeScript

Logfire provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-js) that
enables instrumentation of JavaScript/TypeScript applications. For
implementation details and examples, please refer to the
[package README](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-js?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).
