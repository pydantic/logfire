Logfire is built on top of OpenTelemetry, which means that it supports all the languages that OpenTelemetry supports.

In addition, we currently have custom SDKs for:

- [Python](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-js)
- [Rust](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-rust)

These SDKs offer a streamlined developer experience.

You can check our [Alternative Clients](how-to-guides/alternative-clients.md) section to see how
you can send data to Logfire from other languages.
