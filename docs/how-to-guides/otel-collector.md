# OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector is a powerful tool that can be used to collect, process, and export telemetry data from various sources.
It is designed to work with a wide range of data sources and can be easily configured to meet your specific needs.
It can be run in a multitude of topologies, including as a standalone service, as a sidecar in a container, or as an agent on a host.

Although it is very powerful and versatile the Collector is also an advanced tool that is not required to use Logfire.
If you don't need any of the Collectors features it is perfectly reasonable to send data from the Logfire SDK directly to our backend, and this is the default configuration for our SDK.

Use cases for the OpenTelemetry Collector include:

- **Centralized configuration**: keep Logfire credentials in a single place. Configure exporting to multiple backends (e.g. Logfire and audit logging) in a single place. All with the ability to update the configuration without needing to make changes to applications.
- **Data transformation**: transform data before sending it to Logfire. For example, you can use the OpenTelemetry Collector to filter out sensitive information, extract structured data from logs or otherwise modify the data before sending it to Logfire.
- **Data enrichment**: add additional context to your logs before sending them to Logfire. For example, you can use the OpenTelemetry Collector to add information about the host or container where the log was generated.
- **Collecting existing data sources**: the Collector can be used to collect system logs (e.g. Kubernetes logs) or metrics from other formats. For example, you can use it to collect container logs from Kubernetes and scrape Prometheus metrics.

As Logfire is a fully compliant OpenTelemetry SDK and backend it does not require any special configuration to be used with the OpenTelemetry collector.
Below we include a couple of examples for using the OpenTelemetry collector, assuming the deployment is being done on Kubernetes, but you can deploy the collector in any system, see the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/) for more information.

This documentation does not attempt to be a complete guide to the OpenTelemetry collector, but rather a gentle introduction along with some key examples.
For more information on the collector please see the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

## Sink data into AWS S3

If you want to keep your data stored long-term, the OpenTelemetry Collector offers a great way to send it directly to AWS S3.
You need to configure Logfire SDK to send data to the OpenTelemetry Collector, which will then forward the data to AWS S3.

Here is a simple example of how to send data into Logfire dashboard and AWS S3.

First, you'll need to set up two things in AWS:

1. An S3 bucket.
2. An IAM user who has permission to write to that S3 bucket.

Here is the example OpenTelemetry Collector configuration that sends data to AWS S3:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"
exporters:
  awss3:
    s3uploader:
      region: eu-central-1
      s3_bucket: test-otel-bucket
processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 32768
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [awss3]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [awss3]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [awss3]
```

Run the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```shell
docker run \
    -v ./config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
    -p 4318:4318 \
    otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
```

Then you need to configure Logfire to send data to Logfire backend and OpenTelemetry Collector:

```python title="script.py"
import os

import logfire

os.environ['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT'] = 'http://localhost:4318'

logfire.configure()

logfire.info('Hello, {name}!', name='world')
```

After running the script, you should see the data in the **Logfire** UI and the data will also be stored in your S3 bucket.

Take a look at [Use Alternative Backends](./alternative-backends.md) for more information on how to configure the Logfire SDK to send data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

You can find more information on the `awss3` exporter in the [AWS S3 Exporter for OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awss3exporter).

## Collecting system logs

This example shows how you can use the OpenTelemetry collector to collect systems logs (logs on stdoutt/stderr) from Kubernetes and send them to Logfire.
This may be useful as part of a migration to Logfire if you aren't able to immediately edit all of the applications to install the Logfire SDK, although the data you receive won't be as rich as it would be from tracing with the Logfire SDK.

This relatively simple example is enough in many cases to replace existing systems like ElasticSearch, Loki or Splunk.

To follow this guide you'll need to have a local Kubernetes cluster running.
There are many options for this including [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-docker-desktop/), [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start).

We'll first create an application via `apps.yaml` that emits some structured and unstructured logs to stdout/stderr:

```yaml title="apps.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: plain-app
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: plain-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: plain-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: plain-app
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1
      containers:
        - name: plain-app
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Hello World'; sleep 1; done"]
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: json-app
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: json-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: json-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: json-app
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1
      containers:
        - name: json-app
          image: busybox
          command:
            - "sh"
            - "-c"
            - |
              while true; do
                now=$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
                echo "{\"message\":\"Hello world!\",\"level\":\"warn\",\"timestamp\":\"$now\"}"
                sleep 1
              done
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
```

Deploy this application via `kubectl apply -f apps.yaml`.

Now we will set up a collector that can scrape logs from these apps, process them and send them to logfire.

We'll need to store Logfire credentials somewhere, a Kubernetes Secret is a reasonable choice, a better choice for a production environment would be to use [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/).

First create a Logfire write token, see [Create Write Tokens](./create-write-tokens.md).

Now to save it as a secret in Kubernetes run the following command, replacing `your-write-token` with the value of the write token you just created:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic logfire-token --from-literal=logfire-token=your-write-token
```

Note that this is equivalent to the following `secrets.yaml` file, but using `kubectl` is easier because it will base64 encode the secret for you.

```yaml title="secrets.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: logfire-token
type: Opaque
data:
  logfire-token: base64-encoded-logfire-token
```

For the OTel Collector to scrape logs it will need permissions into the Kubernetes API which Kubernetes does not give out by default (you wouldn't want random pods being able to see logs from other pods by default!).

To do this we'll create an `rbac.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml title="rbac.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["replicasets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-rolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: default
```

Apply this configuration via `kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml`.

Now we can create the deployment for the collector itself.
There are [several options for deploying the OTel collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/collector/components) including:

- As a sidecar container on each / some pods. This requires less permissions but implies manual configuration of each deployment with a sidecar. This option may work well if you want to bolt on **Logfire** to specific existing applications you control without modifying the application itself or deploying the collector cluster wide.
- As a DaemonSet, this will deploy the collector on every node in the cluster. This is a good option if you want to collect logs from all pods in the cluster without modifying each deployment. Additionally DaemonSets can collect certain information that is not available to sidecars or services. This is the option we will use in this guide.
- As a Service/Gateway, this option that allows you to deploy the collector as a standalone Kubernetes service.

Create a `collector.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml title="collector.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-config
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    receivers:
      filelog:
        include_file_path: true
        include:
          - /var/log/pods/*/*/*.log
        exclude:
          # Exclude logs from all containers named otel-collector
          - /var/log/pods/*/otel-collector/*.log
        operators:
          - id: container-parser
            type: container
          - id: json_parser
            type: json_parser
            if: 'hasPrefix(body, "{\"")'
            parse_from: body
            parse_to: attributes
            parse_ints: true
            timestamp:
              parse_from: attributes.timestamp
              layout_type: strptime
              layout: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z"
            severity:
              parse_from: attributes.level
              overwrite_text: true
    exporters:
      debug:
      otlphttp:
        # Configure the US / EU endpoint for Logfire.
        # - US: https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev
        # - EU: https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev
        endpoint: "https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev"
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer ${env:LOGFIRE_TOKEN}"
    service:
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [filelog]
          exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  labels:
    app: opentelemetry
    component: otel-collector
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: opentelemetry
      component: otel-collector
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: opentelemetry
        component: otel-collector
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: otel-collector
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1
      containers:
      - name: otel-collector
        image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.128.0
        env:
        - name: LOGFIRE_TOKEN
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: logfire-token
              key: logfire-token
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/log
          name: varlog
          readOnly: true
        - mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
          name: varlibdockercontainers
          readOnly: true
        - mountPath: /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
          name: data
          subPath: config.yaml
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
      - name: varlibdockercontainers
        hostPath:
          path: /var/lib/docker/containers
      - name: data
        configMap:
          name: otel-collector-config
```

Apply this configuration via `kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml`.

You should now see logs from the `plain-app` and `json-app` in your Logfire dashboard!

## Add Kubernetes attributes to traces, logs and metrics

This example shows how to enrich your existing applications traces, logs and metrics with Kubernetes metadata, such as the deployment, node and namespace name.

It is supported by OpenTelemetry Collector in either daemonset or gateway deployment mode with no configuration changes, you can refer to the [OTel collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/platforms/kubernetes/collector/components) for more information about the deployment patterns.

First, you need to setup RBAC for the OpenTelemetry Collector to access the metadata you'll need, for example:

```yaml title="rbac.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - 'pods'
      - 'namespaces'
    verbs:
      - 'get'
      - 'watch'
      - 'list'
  - apiGroups:
      - 'apps'
    resources:
      - 'replicasets'
      - 'deployments'
      - 'statefulsets'
      - 'daemonsets'
    verbs:
      - 'get'
      - 'list'
      - 'watch'
  - apiGroups:
      - 'extensions'
    resources:
      - 'replicasets'
    verbs:
      - 'get'
      - 'list'
      - 'watch'
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: otel-collector
    namespace: otel-collector
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

If you want to limit the access to a single namespace you can use `Role` and `RoleBinding` with minimal changes documented below.

This is useful if you're running multiple instances of the Collector and you want to limit their access scope.

Now, you need to enable the `k8sattributes` processor in the collector config:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-config
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    receivers:
      # an otlp receiver, you can configure your application to send data to it
      # for enrichment and processing before exporting to Logfire.
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"
          http:
            endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"
    processors:
      # by default the connection IP is used to match data with k8s object
      # when using, for example, a daemonset to send logs to a gateway
      # you can use `pod_association` to configure which fields to use for matching.
      pod_association:
        - sources:
            - from: resource_attribute
              name: k8s.pod.uid
      # If you're using a namespaced RBAC, you'll need to set this filter
      # filter:
      #   namespace: default
      extract:
        metadata:
          # the cluster's UID won't be set with the namespaced configuration
          - k8s.cluster.uid
          - k8s.pod.name
          - k8s.pod.uid
          - k8s.deployment.name
          - k8s.namespace.name
          - k8s.node.name
          - k8s.pod.start_time
          - k8s.replicaset.name
          - k8s.replicaset.uid
          - k8s.daemonset.name
          - k8s.daemonset.uid
          - k8s.job.name
          - k8s.job.uid
          - k8s.cronjob.name
          - k8s.statefulset.name
          - k8s.statefulset.uid
          - container.image.name
          - container.image.tag
          - container.id
          - k8s.container.name
          - container.image.name
          - container.image.tag
          - container.id
    exporters:
      debug:
      otlphttp:
        # Configure the US / EU endpoint for Logfire.
        # - US: https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev
        # - EU: https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev
        endpoint: "https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev"
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer ${env:LOGFIRE_TOKEN}"
    service:
      # configure logs, metrics and traces with k8s attributes enrichment
      # before sending them to Logfire.
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [k8sattributes]
          exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [k8sattributes]
          exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [k8sattributes]
          exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
```

After applying this configuration, you should be able to see, query and filter you traces, metrics and logs in Logfire with Kubernetes attributes!

For example:

```sql
SELECT exception_message
FROM records
WHERE is_exception = true
AND otel_resource_attributes->>'k8s.namespace.name' = 'default';
```

You can find more information about the `k8sattributes` processor in the [Kubernetes Attributes Processor for OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor).
