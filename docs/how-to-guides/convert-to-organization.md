# How to Convert a Personal Account to an Organization

Logfire allows you to convert your personal account into an organization, making it easier to collaborate with a team and manage projects at scale. This is also handy for users upgrading to Pro, who might want to move projects under a corporate organization name.

This guide walks you through the conversion process step by step.

## 2. Start the Conversion

Click **Convert to org**. A modal will appear, outlining the main points of the conversion:

- All existing **projects, members, alerts, dashboards, and settings** will be moved to the new organization.
- **Write tokens** will continue to work; you do not need to change any ingest URLs.
- You'll define your new organization's **handle** and **display name**.
- You can optionally edit the username and display name for your new personal account.

- The project URLs will change from:
  `https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/your-username/project-name`
  to
  `https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/your-org-handle/project-name`.

## 4. Confirm New Personal Account

After setting up the organization, you'll be prompted to create a new (empty) personal account with the same name as before. You can confirm and complete the conversion, or go back if you wish to make changes.
