## About Logfire

From the team behind **Pydantic**, **Logfire** is a new type of observability platform built on
the same belief as our open source library â€” that the most powerful tools can be easy to use.

**Logfire** is built on OpenTelemetry, and supports monitoring your application from **any language**,
with particularly great support for Python! [Read more](why.md).

## Overview

This page is a quick walk-through for setting up a Python app:

1. [Set up Logfire](#logfire)
2. [Install the SDK](#sdk)
3. [Instrument your project](#instrument)

## Set up Logfire {#logfire}

1. [Log into Logfire :material-open-in-new:](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/login){:target="_blank"}
2. Follow the prompts to create your account
3. Once logged in, you'll see the **Welcome to Logfire** prompt. Click **Let's go!** to go to the **starter-project** Setup page.

![Welcome to Logfire](images/logfire-screenshot-welcome-to-logfire.png)

4. You will find how to send data to your **starter-project** there. Also, there are some code snippets to help you get started.

!!! info ""
    A **Logfire** project is a namespace for organizing your data. All data sent to **Logfire** must be associated with a project.

??? tip "Ready to create your own projects in UI or CLI?"
- In the UI, create projects by navigating to the Organization > Projects page, and click **New project**. 
 - For CLI check the [SDK CLI documentation](reference/cli.md#create-projects-new).
## Install the SDK {#sdk}

1. In the terminal, install the **Logfire** SDK (Software Developer Kit):

{{ install_logfire() }}

2. Once installed, try it out!

```bash
logfire -h
```

3. Next, authenticate your local environment:

```bash
logfire auth
```

!!! info ""
    Upon successful authentication, credentials are stored in `~/.logfire/default.toml`.

## Instrument your project {#instrument}
=== ":material-cog-outline: Development"
    !!! tip "Development setup"
        During development, we recommend using the CLI to configure Logfire.
        You can also use a [write token](how-to-guides/create-write-tokens.md).

    1. Set your project

    ```bash title="in the terminal:"
    logfire projects use <first-project>
    ```

    !!! info ""
        Run this command from the root directory of your app, e.g. `~/projects/first-project`

    2. Write some basic logs in your Python app

    ```py title="hello_world.py"
    import logfire

    logfire.configure()  # (1)!
    logfire.info('Hello, {name}!', name='world')  # (2)!
    ```

    3. The `configure()` method should be called once before logging to initialize **Logfire**.
    4. This will log `Hello world!` with `info` level.

    !!! info ""
        Other [log levels][logfire.Logfire] are also available to use, including `trace`, `debug`, `notice`, `warn`,
        `error`, and `fatal`.


    3. See your logs in the **Live** view

=== ":material-cloud-outline: Production"
    !!! tip "Production setup"
        In production, we recommend you provide your write token to the Logfire SDK via environment variables.

    1. Generate a new write token in the **Logfire** platform

        - Go to Project :material-chevron-right: Settings :material-chevron-right: Write Tokens
        - Follow the prompts to create a new token


    2. Configure your **Logfire** environment

    ```bash title="In the terminal:"
    export LOGFIRE_TOKEN=<your-write-token>
    ```

    !!! info ""
        Running this command stores a Write Token used by the SDK to send data to a file in the current directory, at `.logfire/logfire_credentials.json`

    3. Write some basic logs in your Python app

    ```py title="hello_world.py"
    import logfire

    logfire.configure()  # (1)!
    logfire.info('Hello, {name}!', name='world')  # (2)!
    ```

    1. The `configure()` method should be called once before logging to initialize **Logfire**.
    2. This will log `Hello world!` with `info` level.

    !!! info ""
        Other [log levels][logfire.Logfire] are also available to use, including `trace`, `debug`, `notice`, `warn`,
        `error`, and `fatal`.
