## OpenTelemetry Integrations

Since **Pydantic Logfire** is [OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry] compatible, it can be used with any OpenTelemetry
instrumentation package. You can find the list of all OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages
[here](https://opentelemetry-python-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Below you can see more details on how to use Logfire with some of the most popular Python packages.

If you are using Logfire with a web application, we also recommend reviewing
our [Web Frameworks](web-frameworks/index.md)
documentation.

## Custom Integrations

We have special integration with the Pydantic library and the OpenAI SDK:

| Package                        | Type            |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| [Pydantic](pydantic.md)        | Data Validation |
| [OpenAI](llms/openai.md)       | AI              |
| [Anthropic](llms/anthropic.md) | AI              |

## Logging Integrations

Finally, we also have documentation for how to use Logfire with existing logging libraries:

| Package                                | Type    |
|----------------------------------------|---------|
| [Standard Library Logging](logging.md) | Logging |

## Creating Custom Integrations

If you are a maintainer of a package and would like to create an integration for **Logfire**, you can do it! :smile:

We've created a shim package called `logfire-api`, which can be used to integrate your package with **Logfire**.

The idea of `logfire-api` is that it doesn't have any dependencies. It's a very small package that matches the API of **Logfire**.
We created it so that you can create an integration for **Logfire** without having to install **Logfire** itself.

You can use `logfire-api` as a lightweight dependency of your own package.
If `logfire` is installed, then `logfire-api` will use it. If not, it will use a no-op implementation.
This way users of your package can decide whether or not they want to install `logfire`, and you don't need to
check whether or not it's installed.

Here's how you can use `logfire-api`:

```python
import logfire_api as logfire

logfire.info("Hello, Logfire!")
```

!!! note
    You generally *don't* want to call `logfire_api.configure()`, it's up to your users to call
    `logfire.configure()` if they want to use the integration.

All the **Logfire** API methods are available in `logfire-api`.
