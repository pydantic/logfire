# Django

The [`logfire.instrument_django()`][logfire.Logfire.instrument_django] method can be used to instrument the [Django][django] web framework with **Logfire**.

## Installation

Install `logfire` with the `django` extra:

{{ install_logfire(extras=['django']) }}

## Usage

In the `settings.py` file, add the following lines:

```py
import logfire

# ...All the other settings...

# Add the following lines at the end of the file
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_django()
```

[`logfire.instrument_django()`][logfire.Logfire.instrument_django] uses the
**OpenTelemetry Django Instrumentation** package,
which you can find more information about [here][opentelemetry-django].

!!! note
    The above lines must be the last thing to execute in your settings. On a regular Django project, this means
    at the end of `settings.py`. If you use an exotic configuration setup with several settings files divided into
    `local/prod/dev`, make sure you put those lines where they will be imported and executed last. Otherwise, the
    instrumentation might not work as expected.

## Instrumenting Django ORM Queries

To instrument Django ORM queries, you need to install the associated DB instrumentation tool, then add the corresponding instrumentation command to your ‚Äç`settings.py` file.

By default, the **Django** configuration [uses SQLite as the database engine].
To instrument it, you need to call [`logfire.instrument_sqlite3()`][logfire.Logfire.instrument_sqlite3].

If you are using a different database, check the available instrumentation methods in our [Integrations section].
