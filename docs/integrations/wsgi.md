# WSGI

If the [WSGI][wsgi] framework doesn't have a dedicated OpenTelemetry package, you can use the
[OpenTelemetry WSGI middleware][opentelemetry-wsgi].

## Installation

You need to install the [`opentelemetry-instrumentation-wsgi`][pypi-otel-wsgi] package:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-wsgi
```

## Usage

Below we have a minimal example using the standard library [`wsgiref`][wsgiref]. You can run it with `python main.py`:

```py title="main.py"
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

from opentelemetry.instrumentation.wsgi import OpenTelemetryMiddleware


def app(env, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type','text/html')])
    return [b"Hello World"]

app = OpenTelemetryMiddleware(app)

with make_server("", 8000, app) as httpd:
    print("Serving on port 8000...")

    # Serve until process is killed
    httpd.serve_forever()
```

You can read more about the OpenTelemetry WSGI middleware [here][opentelemetry-wsgi].
