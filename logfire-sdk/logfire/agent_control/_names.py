Both cores and the Logfire UI have to land on the same variable for the same agent, or a Pydantic AI
agent and a Mastra agent called `checkout-assistant` quietly hold two different configs while the UI
shows one. The rule is therefore stated once, here, with cross-language vectors in
`spec/agent-name.json`, rather than reimplemented per language.

    Lowercasing is the part worth justifying, because it is the lossy one. The rule exists to make
    two SDKs agree with the Logfire UI, and the UI's own rule -- the one the Pydantic AI harness
    already applies to an agent's telemetry name -- lowercases. Diverging from it would mean an
    agent named `Checkout Assistant` in one service and `checkout_assistant` in another shows up as
    two configs in a UI that only ever renders one name for them. It is lossy in the other
    direction too: `checkout-assistant`, `Checkout Assistant`, and `checkout_assistant` are one key,
    so two genuinely different agents whose names differ only in punctuation or case share a config.
    Give them explicit, distinct names when that is not what you want.
