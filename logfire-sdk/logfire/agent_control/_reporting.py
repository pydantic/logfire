"""What to do with a published entry that reaches nothing in this deployment.

That is an instruction `id` no block carries (or that only a dynamic block carries), a tool override
whose `name` -- and `toolset`, when it sets one -- matches no tool the agent advertises, a `settings`
key the contract or the adapter cannot apply, and a whole section this adapter or this release has no
way to act on. Each is a place where Logfire shows one thing and the agent does another.

- `'warn'` (the default everywhere) emits a `UserWarning` once per process per message.
- `'error'` raises [`UnmatchedConfigError`][logfire.agent_control.UnmatchedConfigError] naming every
  issue at once, failing the request.
- `'ignore'` applies nothing and says nothing.

The policy is applied in one place, by
[`AgentControl.report`][logfire.agent_control.AgentControl.report], rather than inside each apply
helper: an adapter plans every section and then reports, so `'error'` fails on everything the request
would have got wrong rather than on whichever section happened to be planned first.

Warning rather than raising is the default because tool availability is dynamic: one config is
applied across deployments that need not all install the same tools, and an agent can advertise
different tools from one request to the next, so an entry that reaches nothing here may be exactly
right somewhere else. `'error'` is for the deployment that would rather stop than run with part of
its published config silently unapplied.

"""Why one published entry did not reach the request, as a stable string an adapter can branch on.

Instructions:

- `'unknown-id'` -- an `id` this request assembles no block under.
- `'dynamic-id'` -- an `id` only a block the framework recomputes per request carries, which cannot
  be replaced or dropped without pinning or removing that computation.
- `'oversized-text'` -- text past the contract's per-request budget, which is refused rather than
  truncated: half a prompt is not a smaller version of the prompt.

Tools:

- `'unknown-tool'` -- a `name` (narrowed by `toolset` when the entry sets one) no advertised tool has.
- `'unknown-parameter'` -- a `parameters` key the tool's schema has no top-level property for.
- `'no-patchable-schema'` -- the tool, or that one property, has no object schema to patch a
  description into at all.
- `'rename-collision'` -- a `new_name` another advertised tool, or a name the adapter reserved,
  already answers to. The rename is dropped and the tool keeps its code-side name; the same entry's
  other patches still apply.

Settings:

- `'unknown-setting'` -- a `settings` key this version of the contract has no field for, which a
  newer Logfire UI can write.
- `'unsupported-setting'` -- a canonical key this adapter declared it cannot lower; see
  [`AgentSupport.settings`][logfire.agent_control.AgentSupport.settings].
- `'unrepresentable-timeout'` -- a `timeout` that is not a request budget: negative, not finite, or
  past [`MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`][logfire.agent_control.MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS].

Any section:

- `'unknown-section'` -- a top-level key this release has no section for. Every section is optional
  and unknown keys cost nothing, which is what lets a future section be written against an older SDK
  -- but the drop has to be audible, or the first person to publish one gets a silently degraded
  agent.
- `'unsupported-section'` -- a section this release understands and this adapter cannot apply; see
  [`AgentSupport.sections`][logfire.agent_control.AgentSupport.sections].
- `'duplicate-entry'` -- the same instruction `id`, or the same `(toolset, name)`, written twice. The
  first is applied and the rest are not.
- `'dropped-by-provider'` -- a setting the adapter did forward and the provider or its SDK dropped;
  see [`ApplyIssue.dropped_by_provider`][logfire.agent_control.ApplyIssue.dropped_by_provider].

These are the runtime decisions: what a *valid* published value did not reach in *this* deployment,
on *this* request. They are deliberately not the parser's compatibility warnings -- an entry a newer
UI wrote that this release cannot understand -- which are about the value rather than the request,
warn once per process from validation, and never take an `OnUnmatched` policy.
