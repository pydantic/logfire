## [v0.51.0] (2024-08-22)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **System metrics are no longer collected by default** when the correct dependency is installed. Use [`logfire.instrument_system_metrics()`](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/system-metrics/) to enable system metrics collection. **If you are simply using the old 'Basic System Metrics' dashboard, then no further code changes are required, but that dashboard will no longer work properly and you should create a new dashboard from the template named 'Basic System Metrics (Logfire)'**. If you were using other collected metrics, see the documentation for how to collect those. By @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/373
* Stop collecting package versions by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/387
* Don't auto-trace generators by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/386
* Disable ASGI send/receive spans by default by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/371

### Other fixes

* Add py.typed file to logfire-api by @jackmpcollins in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/379
* Check `LambdaRuntimeClient` before logging tracebacks in `_ensure_flush_after_aws_lambda` by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/388

## [v0.50.1] (2024-08-06)

(Previously released as `v0.50.0`, then yanked due to https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/issues/367)

* **BREAKING CHANGES:** Separate sending to Logfire from using standard OTEL environment variables by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/351. See https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/advanced/alternative_backends/ for details. Highlights:
  * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is no longer just an alternative to `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL`. Setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`, and/or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` will set up appropriate exporters *in addition* to sending to Logfire, which must be turned off separately if desired. These are basic exporters relying on OTEL defaults. In particular they don't use our custom retrying logic.
  * `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` / `logfire.configure(base_url=...)` is now only intended for actual alternative Logfire backends, which are currently only available to Logfire developers, and unlike `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` requires authenticating with Logfire.
  * Pending spans are only sent to logfire-specific exporters.

* Turn `ParamSpec` non-private by @Kludex in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/361

## [v0.49.0] (2024-08-05)

* Add `logfire.instrument_mysql()` by @aditkumar72 in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/341
* Set OTEL status description when logging exceptions by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/348

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove default for `modules` parameter of `install_auto_tracing` by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/261
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Check if logfire token is valid in separate thread, so `logfire.configure` won't block startup and will no longer raise an exception for an invalid token, by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/274

* Fix backfill command by @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/243
* Update Anthropic to use tools that are no longer in beta by @willbakst in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/249
    - Anthropic instrumentation now requires `anthropic>=0.27.0`

## [v0.40.0] (2024-06-04)

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** The `processors` parameter of `logfire.configure()` has been replaced by `additional_span_processors`. Passing `processors` will raise an error. Unlike `processors`, setting `additional_span_processors` to an empty sequence will not disable the default span processor which exports to Logfire. To do that, pass `send_to_logfire=False`. Similarly `metric_readers` has been replaced by `additional_metric_reader`. By @alexmojaki in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/233

## [v0.39.0] (2024-06-03)

Add new methods for easier integration in https://github.com/pydantic/logfire/pull/207:

* `instrument_flask`
* `instrument_starlette`
* `instrument_aiohttp_client`
* `instrument_sqlalchemy`
* `instrument_pymongo`
* `instrument_redis`

## [v0.38.0] (2024-05-31)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Calling `logfire.info`, `logfire.error`, `logfire.span` etc. will no longer automatically configure logfire if it hasn't been configured already. Instead it will emit a warning and not log anything.
Users must call `logfire.configure()` before they want logging to actually start, even if they don't pass any arguments to `configure` and all configuration is done by environment variables.
Using integrations like `logfire.instrument_fastapi()` before calling `configure` will also emit a warning but it will still set up the instrumentation, although it will not log anything until `configure` is called.

## [v0.37.0] (2024-05-29)
